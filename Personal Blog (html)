      <p>My Experience about Golkonda fort..</p>
      <p>Finally the day has arrived saw the worlds oldest fort. and i had a lot of experience on it and learned a lot about our history. The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud walls.It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199–1262 built a stone hilltop outpost later known as Golconda fort to defend their western region.</p>

      <p>My Experience on Rameswaram Temple..</p>
      <p>It was a wonderful experience i had. It was very nostalgic moment for me and its one of my favourite gods. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, the sacred sites glorified by the Nayanars (Shaivite poet-saints), Appar, Sundarar, and Sambandar, with their songs.It was built by King Muthuramalinga  </p>
